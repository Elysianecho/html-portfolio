  Angela Yu is my current instructor for my studies in web development. My favourite color is Green and I like pets; cats and dogs. My hobbies include travelling, currently on a mission to finish my euro trip. I also like archery, drawing and working out. Music is everything to me as it constitutes a major part of my time and also my identity. My favourite food is meat;chicken,pork,beef,lamb,rabbit. I have a pet cat, a ragdoll,white fur dark patches on the center of her forehead, and has beautiful blue eyes. Her name is Whiskers and she's been with me for 3 years now.

  I hope to become a good fullstack developer eventually and be able to make a living out of it and also contribute towards my future dream of creating an app that connects physiotherapists and clients while providing the best platform for interaction and rendering services and advice.
